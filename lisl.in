TH(lisl)
.SH NAME
lisl \- twentysomething years of not giving a damn
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lisl
calls herself a girl, fwiw.
.PP
.B lisl
is a bit like Hermione Granger, but doesn't change her clothes THAT often.
Also the number of guys waiting for her legal age wasn't THAT large.
.PP
The glorious golden
.B lisl
award (along with the less-glorious silver, broze and the totally awesome
platinum variations) is named after her. It is awarded on memorable acts
of cluelessness.
.PP
On a related note, the grade of uglyness is measured by comparing to her
sunglasses, which have the number one. No known object has yet passed the 1
mark, so it is reasonable to assume that it is a law of nature that 1 is the
theoretical maximum.
