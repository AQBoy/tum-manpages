.SH NAME
lars \- the endless pursuit of nerdvana
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B
lars
has the incredible skill of solving formal problems in such a complex way that
nobody will even try to understand what he is doing (i.e. by bringing up a long
forgotten lemma).
.PP
.B
lars
is, what other people might describe as the definition of nerd. He wastes a lot
of time on IRC, has some strange insider-only humor and speaks in memes. Though,
unlike the typical definition of nerds, he is neither fat nor stinks (at least
as war as we have been able to verify).
.PP
As a strict non-drinker,
.B
lars
has been seen suprisingly often in pubs in Northern Ireland, but maybe it is
Ireland that leads people to alkoholism and irish dance (which
.B
lars
does as well).
.PP
.B
lars
best female friend is called
.ul
Isabelle
and is a theorem-solver. So much for that, bitches (although bitches say that
.B
lars
is kinda cute)!
.PP
As for My Little Pony, his favorite pony is
.ul
Twilight Sparkle
of course, because she's a nerd as well and lives in a library. In Equestria
they don't have computers because using a keyboard with hooves is an frustrating
exercise.
