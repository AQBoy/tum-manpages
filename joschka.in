.SH DESCRIPTION
.B joschka
is a computer science student from somewhere outside of Bavaria where there
are apparently no standards on education. Or at least noone can imagine
how he managed to get his a-levels.
.PP
His favourite activities include chatting during days and night, reading
4players, Golem and Heise. He also spends money on games from Steam, so
that other friends who visit him have something to do.
.PP
Don't let him change the font settings of your computer. He apparently likes
ugly fontrendering that is even more unreadable as the one that Apple uses.
.PP
.B joschka
is a total HTML5 weenie, moving all his stuff into the browser. Therefore using
totally atrocious web clients for everything, because it it cool and Web 2.0-y.
Also plays the newest 3D games in the browser.. oh, maybe not. Of course, the
only real browser for
.B joschka
is Chrome (mind you, only the proprietary build from Google, not Chromium).
.PP
Despite living in the worst city ever, his room is basically the center of
his friend circle with people often inviting themselves, eating his food,
and staying overnight. He doesn't seem to give a damn when people squat at his
place.
