.PP
.B antonia
exhibits opinions on computer science and programming that vary between 'most
useless and frustrating stuff ever, you'd have to be insane to keep
yourselve busy with such a crap!!!111' and 'high art of mind, this is how
God must have felt when he created the world'. Therefore her dependability concerning programming skills is not that reliable.
