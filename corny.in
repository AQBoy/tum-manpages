.SH DESCRIPTION
.B corny
is the wackiest one around, wearing shirts from GTA and being generally quite
WTF. You have never seen a collection of "Festivalbandl" as large as his. Even
his watch, though with a broken closing mechanism, integrates nicely into the
mess on his arm.

corny
is oftentimes abused as Taxi driver who drives people from the StuSta to
Garching to play pen & paper RPG or other people home.
.PP
He's a great fan of useless Flash movies and games like most notably "Shut up
woman get on my horse" but also other weirdness like z0r.de or similar.
.PP
Although you wouldn't guess,
.B
corny
is quite skilled, writing bootkits for Linux kernels and trojan horses for Windows. Oh yeah and HE CAN HAZ MATH.
.PP
He works for the Carle faculty which is, like, the definition of lame and measures the size of the internet. For whoever cares.
